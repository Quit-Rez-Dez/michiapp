# Michiapp

Michi app for AZUMO

## Getting Started

MICHIapp gives you a random cat from  [cataas](https://cataas.com/#/) every time you push the Meow button

## How i build this project

Firts you need to create a basic skeletor of your app how you whant that your app looks like,create a sketch of it
I use the refereence of the example in the integration part of the cataas  [page](https://cataas.com/#/integration), here you
can find an example of an app in [kotlin](https://github.com/allan8araujo/CatApp/tree/appCat)

So I create the button and the container of the image and fit the image to it to start with something.
